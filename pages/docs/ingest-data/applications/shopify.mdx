#### NOTE

For better experience with `Incremental Refresh` the following is recommended:

* `Order Refunds`, `Order Risks`, `Transactions` should be synced along with `Orders` stream.
* `Discount Codes` should be synced along with `Price Rules` stream.

If child streams are synced alone from the parent stream - the full sync will take place, and the records are filtered out afterwards.
