# Creating a Y42 Organization 

Organizations are the highest level organizational structure in Y42. These units allow you to manage a set of users, teams, and spaces and configure organization-wide settings like billing.

Here we provide a quick overview of the necessary steps to create a Y42 organization.

<Steps className="">
### Get you Organization Code

Once you confirm your Y42 membership, our staff should send you two e-mails: One with the credentials to create your user account and one with the organization creation code. By default, you'll receive a single organization code per Y42 contract. If, for any reason your use case requires having two separate organizations, please don't hesitate to reach out to our Customer Success team.

### Create your Y42 Organisation

You can create organizations from the main menu after logging into the app. The setup flow follows the next steps:

1. Click on 'Add Organization'
2. Introduce the unique Organization Code
3. Complete the organization information - only slug and name are required
4. Go ahead and create your first Y42 space! ðŸš€
