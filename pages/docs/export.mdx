# What is a Data Export?

In the Data Export workspace you can set up automated jobs to export data into an external application, such as Google Sheets or a Google Big Query dataset. You might know this product feature in v1 plattform under the name "Automation".

The data to be exported can be either an output table from a model built in Y42 or a table from a data source connected via a Y42 integration.
