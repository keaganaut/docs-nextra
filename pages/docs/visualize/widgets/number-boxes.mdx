# Create a Number Box


A number box returns the sum, average, minimum, maximum, count, or distinct count of a measure. A number box is an effective format to quickly convey your KPIs as it shows changes between the current and the last period in a simple manner.

To create a number box, follow the next steps:
    1. Click on the number box icon.
    2. Drag and drop a metric you're interested in into the Measures field.
    3. Drag and drop a date dimension into the Breakdown by Date field.
    4. By default, a number box will sum up measure values by date periods. To change an aggregate function, click on SUM and / or Year.

## Filters and Underlying Data

On a widget level, users can also set particular filters by dataset variables. To do so, you can drag and drop variables from the measures and dimensions field and then apply a filter to the variable you chose.

By clicking on __Data__, you will get a preview of the data used to build a widget.
