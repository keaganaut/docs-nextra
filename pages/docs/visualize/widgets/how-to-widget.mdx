## How to work with Widgets

### Create a Widget & Select a Data Source

Visualization widgets are the main component of your dashboards and allow you to quickly visualize your data and dive deep into data analytics.

You can create widgets inside a dashboard tab or directly from the Widget List View

Inside a dashboard tab:
    1. Go to Edit Mode
    2. Select the widget icon from the canvas toolbar and place the widget on the canvas
    3. Select 'Create a Widget'
    4. Select a data table to create a widget from the list presented to you. You can use output tables from models or select tables directly from integrations.

### Build a Widget

You can a build a widget in 2-5 simple steps.

1. From the list of fields, select all Dimensions, Measures or Calculated Fields that you wish to use in your widget. This can be done in one of 3 ways:

    1. By dragging the field into your chosen drop area
    2. By selecting the check mark next to the field, allowing Y42 to suggest a drop area for the field
    3. By selecting 'Edit columns' in your chosen drop area

2. Choose your widget type. Currently, we support Simple Charts, Scatter Plots, Number Boxes, Pie Charts, Treemaps, Tables (simple & pivot), and Cohort Tables.

3. If necessary, change the settings for an individual field.

    1. To change display settings, go to the field settings dropdown next to the field
    2. To change the aggregation type for a field (e.g. AVG, SUM, YEAR, YEAR & MONTH), hover & select the aggregation text

4. If necessary, change widget-level settings such as the axis display format. To do this, head to the settings tab for the widget. Note that these settings overwrite global settings you apply on a dashboard level.

5. If necessary, apply filters on the displayed widget. These filters are applied in addition to any dashboard filters. To do this, either:
    1. Drag the filtering field into the filters drop area
    2. Select the Filters button in the widget builder

Lastly, don't forget to save & close your widget! You'll need to give it a name, and you can give it a description if you would like.
