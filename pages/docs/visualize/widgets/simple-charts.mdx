# Create a Simple Chart (Bar/ Line/ Area)

Simple Bar, Line & Area charts allow you to compare data across multiple categories. Follow these steps to build a simple chart:
    1. Drag and drop measures to __Summarize By.__ 
    2. Add dimensions to __Segment By__ and __Breakdown By.__
        * __Segment By__ - Summarizes measures by categories. In our example, we segmented a numeric variable, Spend, by Year & Month.
        * __Breakdown By__ - Splits measures within each segment by other categories. In our example, for each combination of Year & Month, we break down spend into two groups - Facebook and Google.

## Variable-Level Settings

There are two different setting types that you can apply to variables used in a widget: aggregate functions and appearance.

### Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions greatly depend on the variable type: numeric, dates, categorical. To change an aggregate function, simply click on it as shown below:

### Appearance Settings

#### Breakdown By

In Breakdown By, you can turn a simple bar, line or area chart into a stacked one, where each dimension doesn't have a separate bar anymore but rather is stacked on top of each other. It is also possible to normalize a breakdown by stacking it to 100%:

#### Summarize By

In Summarize By, you can find settings that are applied to or created based on measures. Below, we will describe each of them in detail.

    - __Mark:__ bar, line, or area.
    - __Stack:__ settings for group stacks.
    - __Format:__ change how your numbers are displayed - rounding, separators, negative values, and currency.
    - __Filter:__ you may apply filters based on the same variable as used in Summarize By or any other variable you have in a dataset.
    - __Show percentage:__ display numbers in relative terms. Note that a chart will display the percentage of each breakdown value out of the total value taken as 100%. 
    - __Cumulate:__ cumulative values based on the sort. In our case, based on dates. 
    - __Show right axis:__ you may want to add a second axis in case your measures differ significantly in absolute terms across breakdowns: imagine that "Facebook spend" includes millions and "Google spend" - just hundreds. Adding a second axis will help to communicate data clearer.
    - __Show tooltip:__ a tooltip is a pop-up window that appears once you place a cursor on a bar. It shows more detailed information about the data behind a chart.
    - __Show label:__ labels are numbers that appear on bars.

### Widget-Level Settings

In Settings, you can change the appearance of a widget. This includes:

    - __Legend:__ show names of Breakdown By categories and corresponding colors.
    - __Flip Axis:__ turn a horizontal bar chart into a vertical one and vice versa.
    - __Axis Pointer:__ axis pointer shows numbers on the existing axes. This feature is especially helpful for large charts and charts with double axes.
    - __Sorting:__ sort bars in descending or ascending order by measures or dimensions.
    - __X- and Y-Axis:__ change the appearance of axes: rotate category names, change the font and its size, adjust margins, etc. You can also perform a log-transformation of values.
    - __Data Zoom:__ choose an interval of values that you would like to analyze separately.

### Filters and Underlying Data

On a widget level, users can also set particular filters by dataset variables. To do so, you can drag and drop variables from the measures and dimensions field and then apply a filter to the variable you chose.

By clicking on __Data__, you will get a preview of the data used to build a widget.
