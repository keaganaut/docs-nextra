# Create a Treemap

Treemaps are chart types used to display data in nested rectangles. By adding dimensions, you define the structure of a treemap, and measures to set the size of each rectangle. Treemaps are best suited for showing metrics by multiple categories or drill down to different levels of data granularity.

To create a treemap follow the next steps:

    1. Choose Treemap in the widget editor.
    2. Drag and drop numeric variables or metrics of your interest to Measures.
    3. Drag and drop a dimension to View By. This will split a measure into categories.
    4. Drag and drop a dimension to Segment By to split up a measure even further, within each category.

## Aggregate Functions
By clicking on any of the aggregate functions highlighted by bold font, you can change any function you would like to apply. This will change how a treemap looks like: the larger the area, the higher the corresponding value of a measure within a given category.

## Filters and Underlying Data

On a widget level, users can also set particular filters by dataset variables. To do so, you can drag and drop variables from the measures and dimensions field and then apply a filter to the variable you chose.

By clicking on __Data__, you will get a preview of the data used to build a widget.
