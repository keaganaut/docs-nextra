## V. Authenticate if needed (Depends on the type of Data Storage selected).

Now you are inside your newly created data export, by default you enter into the Structure menu of the Export.

Depending on the type of data storage it might ask to authenticate. For data storage like "Excel" or "CSV" there is no need to authenticate.

For authentication visit these articles for:

    - Google Sheets
    - Amazon S3
    - Google Big Query

## VI. Create a trigger.

In order to Create a trigger you need to first select the data table you want to export (Integration, UI-Model or SQL-Model) and next to select the export destination table.

Once saved, the jobs will appear in the Bottom Drawer and you can click __Trigger Full Import__
