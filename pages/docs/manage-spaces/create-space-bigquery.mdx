In order to connect BigQuery with Y42, you will need to have a Google Cloud Platform Account.

<Steps className="">

- Create new GCP project
- Set-Up Billing on Google Cloud Platform

See the [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/manage-billing-account) to read more.


### Create GCP Service Account
In the IAM section of the Google Cloud Platform Administration Console, crate a new Service Account.
Give it these permissions:
- BigQuery Admin
- Storage Admin
- Storage Object Admin

See the [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts) to read more.

### Create json key file for the Service account
Edit the new Service account and add a new JSON key. 
Make sure to save it to a secure location once its generated by GCP.

After these steps, a space and its matching file structure are instantiated.
