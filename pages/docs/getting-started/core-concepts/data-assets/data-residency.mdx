# Data Residency

## Big Query space

If you have set-up [Y42 to run on BigQuery]( /docs/manage-spaces/create-space-bigquery), all your data is stored in your own BigQuery project. You can check where your project is hosting the data by going to Admin & General and clicking on the Google BigQuery icon. There you can see the location of your BigQuery project.

You can query all your data form the respective Big Query datasets.

## Snowflake space

If you have set-up [Y42 to run on Snowflake]( /docs/manage-spaces/create-space-snowflake) , all your data is stored in your own Snowflake instance within the Database you provided Y42 with upon space creation.

You can query all your data form the respective schemas in Snowflake.
