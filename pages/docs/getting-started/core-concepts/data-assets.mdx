# Data Assets

## What is a Data Asset in Y42?
In Y42, data assets are understood as the building blocks that make up data pipelines, as well as the byproducts and outputs generated by them. In this way our definition goes beyond just tables and dashboards, as is the case in some data platforms. Concrete examples of these pipeline elements are integrations, models, orchestrations, widgets, but also tables and dashboards.

Defining everything as an asset helps us achieve consistent metadata across the data lifecycle, fuelling unique governance and collaboration capabilities.

## Bridging Code and Low-Code

Y42 combines the code and low-code paradigms thanks to how the projects are stored within the platform. Any Y42 solution is specified fully in a set of version-controlled files stored in a git repository.

When you build your project using our web interface, your changes are immediately saved in the relevant files. If you prefer working on the files instead, the web interface will reflect the changes you commit. This synchronization allows technical and non-technical users to work together, using the interface that suits their needs better.

## Tables, Tests & Contracts
Y42 provides you with additional tools to keep data quality high and maintain a consistent data architecture across your pipelines. Both models and integrations produce materialized tables in your data warehouse. One can attach data tests and data contracts to tables to guarantee that they meet a set of agreed-upon conditions every time they're populated.

If a table has tests or a contract attached, the job consists of three steps:

1. Table materialization: Creation of the table in your data warehouse
2. Test execution: Configured data tests are run against the materialized table
3. Data contract execution: The conditions defined in the data contract are run against the table
A failure in any of the three individual steps will mark the overall job as invalid. The job can be canceled at any point while the materialization step is incomplete. It is not possible to interrupt it while the tests or the data contract are running.
