# How to create Data Tests for your Output Tables

## What are Data Tests

Data tests is a powerful tool offered by Y42, in order to assure the quality of data.

We all know that data coming from different sources through the pipeline contain the risk of being faulty and errors are very difficult to spot especially if there are thousands and millions of rows.

This is were Data tests come in the rescue. You can set them up easy through the UI of Y42. They can run:

- Manually or every time directly in the table after you set them up.
- Automatically when a table containing the tests is triggered from an [Orchestration](https://docs.y42.com/docs/how-to-set-up-an-orchestration) (or when the Table containing the tests is triggered manually for a full or incremental import).

**Pro tip:** you can use data test not only to check the quality of the data but also to make business decisions!
