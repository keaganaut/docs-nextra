## What's new?
If you're a long-time Y42 user who has used the previous iteration of the platform, many things will be new to you, but much should look and feel familiar. Here's what you should be aware of, in a nutshell:

- All of your integrations, models, widgets, dashboards and more are now being saved to and version-controlled in git. This may take some getting used to at first, but don't worry - you won't have to become a developer, and you won't even have to learn git if you prefer to stick to your existing workflow.
- We introduced a variety of new features for your data pipelines and analytics engineering workflows - among the biggest new additions are data tests, incremental model updates, an improved SQL editing experience, status & business alerts, two-way integration with Airflow and more
- The visualization product has been totally overhauled to include features like: reusable widgets, drill downs, cross-filtering, color palettes, new widget types, and much more.
- You'll be able to communicate inside of Y42 using a new figma-style commenting feature on every data asset
- Our UI has been overhauled in many ways - one of the most notable changes is the new asset sidebar, which is available for all data assets and let's you quickly get an overview of relevant metadata and configuration of an asset without navigating away from your current page. You can even use it to pull up the isolated Lineage for an asset at the click of a button!
