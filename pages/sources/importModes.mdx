# Import Modes



## Full import


Full imports update all tables from the historical date until the current day. 

During a full import, the integration gets all data from the start date to the current day of the source and copies it into the Destination. Full imports include all your selected data.

How long the imports takes depends on the amount of data and the limitations of the source.


## Incremental import

<Callout emoji="ðŸ‘¾">
  **Incremental imports** are not available for csv integrations
</Callout>

This import enables you to extract and load new and modified data from your source into your destination. 

Incremental imports are efficient because they update only new information, instead of re-importing the whole table again.


### Replication methods
<Tabs items={['Application', 'Database']}>
  <Tab>
    To make an import be incremental, the source table has to have a suitable replication key. Some applications provide a cursor field such as updated_at or created_at, but sometimes, it's only possible to find a primary key, such as a task_id.
The existence of a replication key and its type is determined by the App, and will influence if the incremental import works and if it will replicate only new records or updated as well.

Y42 also support Change Data Capture for databases, a strong feature to replicate all your data in near real-time.

    Log-based replication uses the transaction logs that some databases, implement natively as part of their core functionality.
The replication tool looks for logs to identify changes in a database, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations to replicate its data.

Check our database documentation for coverage of CDC and Incremental import.

When log-based CDC is not possible, The standard incremental import for databases will use the key-based method.

Key-Based Incremental Data Replication
Key-based incremental is a method in which the data sources identify new and updated data using the column called the Replication Key. A key can be a timestamp, integer, or datestamp column that exists in the source table. Such as task_id, insert_at,updated_at etc.

Note: Having an auto-incrementing integer as an ID selected as a replication key, may cause the replication to not capture updated rows, because the ID will remain the same.
