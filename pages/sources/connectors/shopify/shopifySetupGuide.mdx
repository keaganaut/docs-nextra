# Shopify Setup Guide

## Authenticate
### Prerequisites
To connect your Shopify account to Y42, you need:
- Access to a Shopify account
- [Authenticated access scopes](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/access-scopes) for Shopify's Admin API

### **Option A:**  Authenticate using `API PASSWORD`

1. Go to `https://YOURSTORE.myshopify.com/admin/apps/private`
2. Enable private development if it isn't enabled
3. Create a private application
4. Select the resources you want to allow access to. Y42 only needs read-level access
   * Note: The UI will show all possible data sources and will show errors when syncing if it doesn't have permissions to access a resource
5. The password under the `Admin API` section is what you'll use as the `api_password` for the integration

### **Option B:**  Authenticate using `OAuth 2.0`

1. Select `OAuth 2.0` in `Shopify Authorization Method`
2. Click on `authenticate`
2. Proceed the authentication using your credentials for your Shopify account
